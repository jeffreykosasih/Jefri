# Port Jeffrey - 3D Portfolio Project

A modern, interactive 3D portfolio built with React, Three.js, and TypeScript featuring an animated island scene with dynamic lighting and particle effects.

## 🚀 **Recent Optimizations & Cleanup**

This project has been thoroughly optimized for performance and maintainability. Here's what was improved:

### **🧹 Removed Unused Files**

- ✅ `src/main.jsx.backup` (147 lines) - Old backup file
- ✅ `public/test.html` (20 lines) - Model testing file
- ✅ `public/index.html` (17 lines) - Incomplete HTML snippet
- ✅ `styles.css` (129 lines) - Unused stylesheet
- ✅ `src/components/PortfolioTitle.tsx` - Unused component
- ✅ `src/components/BackButton.tsx` - Unused component
- ✅ `cache/` and `dist/` directories - Build artifacts

**Total cleanup: ~320+ lines of unused code removed**

### **⚡ Performance Optimizations**

#### **Main App (main.tsx)**

- ✅ Added `React.memo` for heavy components:
  - `MemoizedLazyScene`
  - `MemoizedThemeToggle`
  - `MemoizedBurgerMenu`
- ✅ Memoized expensive calculations with `useMemo`:
  - Responsive styles computation
  - Text styling calculations
  - ClickSpark props configuration
- ✅ Removed unused `AppState` interface
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript type safety issues

#### **Component Optimizations**

- ✅ Removed unused imports (e.g., `cn` utility in BurgerMenu)
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typings
- ✅ Improved prop passing efficiency

### **🔧 Development Experience**

- ✅ Added comprehensive `.gitignore`
- ✅ Build artifacts excluded from version control
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Build time: ~5.6s (optimized)

## 📦 **Tech Stack**

- **3D Graphics**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Animation**: Framer Motion + GSAP
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Custom components

## 🎯 **Key Features**

- **Dynamic 3D Scene**: Interactive island with day/night themes
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking
- **Device Detection**: Adaptive rendering based on device capabilities
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion + custom GSAP animations
- **Interactive Navigation**: 3D floating navigation buttons
- **Particle Systems**: Theme-aware particle effects
- **Progressive Loading**: Lazy-loaded components and assets

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📊 **Performance Features**

### **Build Optimizations**

- Manual code splitting for vendor libraries
- Three.js + React Three Fiber chunked separately
- Animation libraries (Framer Motion + GSAP) in dedicated chunk
- Terser minification with performance settings
- Asset optimization and caching

### **Runtime Optimizations**

- Component memoization for expensive renders
- Device-specific particle counts
- Adaptive WebGL settings based on device capability
- Lazy loading for 3D models and heavy components
- Efficient state management with minimal re-renders

### **Mobile Optimizations**

- Reduced particle counts on mobile devices
- Safe area handling for devices with notches
- Touch-optimized button sizes (44px minimum)
- Simplified lighting for low-performance devices

## 🎨 **Customization**

### **Theme System**

The app automatically detects time of day for default theme:

- **6 AM - 6 PM**: Light mode (day theme)
- **6 PM - 6 AM**: Dark mode (night theme)

Themes affect:

- Lighting setup (sun vs moon + street lamps)
- Particle colors and behavior
- UI color schemes
- 3D model materials

### **Device Adaptation**

Automatic optimization based on:

- Screen size (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Performance capability
- Touch vs mouse input
- Device pixel ratio
- WebGL support level

## 🔮 **Future Optimizations**

### **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Scene Component Refactoring**: Break down the large `Scene.tsx` (1370 lines) into smaller components:

   - `NavigationButtons.tsx` ✅ (created)
   - `ParticleSystem.tsx` ✅ (created)
   - `SkyBackground.tsx` ✅ (created)
   - `LightingSetup.tsx` ✅ (created)
   - `IslandModel.tsx` (extract from Scene.tsx)
   - `WaterSystem.tsx` (extract from Scene.tsx)

2. **Additional Performance Gains**:

   - Implement texture compression for 3D models
   - Add service worker for asset caching
   - Consider WebAssembly for intensive calculations
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Add ESLint + Prettier configuration
   - Set up automated testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
   - Add Storybook for component documentation
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

## 📝 **Architecture Notes**

### **State Management**

- React built-in state management (useState, useEffect)
- Context avoided to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Props drilling kept minimal with component composition

### **Type Safety**

- Full TypeScript coverage
- Strict mode enabled
- Custom interfaces for complex props
- Type-safe Three.js integration

### **Build Strategy**

- ESNext target for modern browsers
- Manual chunking for optimal loading
- Tree shaking enabled
- Dead code elimination

## 🤝 **Contributing**

When making changes:

1. Maintain component memoization patterns
2. Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
3. Test on multiple device types
4. Ensure build artifacts aren't committed
5. Update this README if adding major features
